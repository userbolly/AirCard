This fork adds **monthly tap counters to the existing Mac app**. Your iPhone uses
Apple's built-in Shortcuts Transaction automation to record taps in iCloud Drive;
AirCard reads them and updates card artwork when the phone is connected. No
separate iPhone app is needed. See the [counter setup guide](docs/monthly-counters.md).

## Features
- 🎨 **Custom Card Skins:** Assign custom artwork, textures, or bank logos to Apple Pay and Wallet cards.
- 🔢 **Monthly Tap Counters:** Per-card counts, automatic monthly rollover, plain text overlays, and configurable fonts, colors, placement, shadows, outlines, and label formats. Optional automatic flashing while the Mac is open and the iPhone is connected and verified.
- 🔢 **Lock Screen Passcode Themes (.passthm):** Apply custom keypad button artwork from popular `.passthm` themes directly to iOS 18+ lockscreen.
- 🧩 **Passcode Theme Creator:** Create custom themes from a single wallpaper (Seamless Poster Slicing) or build key-by-key (Individual Keys).
- 🔍 **Interactive Photo Framing:** Pan and zoom artwork directly inside keypad buttons with real-time iPhone preview.
- ✏️ **Edit Existing .passthm Themes:** Open any Cowabunga or Nugget theme package directly in the creator, tweak button artwork, reposition photos, and re-export or flash.
- ⚡ **Per-Card & Bulk Customization:** Set unique artwork for each card or apply one design across all cards with a single click.
- 📱 **Zero-Hassle Card Detection:** Tap any card in your iPhone's Wallet app to detect its hash in real-time.
- 🚀 **100% Standalone (Universal):** Native support for both **Apple Silicon** and **Intel (x86)** Macs. All required device-communication utilities and image engines are pre-bundled inside the app.
- 📦 **Zero Prerequisites:** No Homebrew, Python packages, or terminal setup required for macOS users.

## How to Customize Apple Wallet Cards
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB cable and ensure it is unlocked and trusted.
2. In AirCard, stay on the **Wallet Cards** tab and click **Scan Cards**.
3. On your iPhone:
   - **Double-click the Side (Power) button** to open Apple Pay.
   - Authenticate with **Face ID**.
   - **Tap your card** (or tap it once more) to trigger instant detection!
4. Click on any card mockup or drag & drop an image directly onto the card.
5. Click **Flash Skins**.
6. Force-close the **Wallet** app on your iPhone from the App Switcher (or reboot) to see your new custom card design!

### Card names and missing-card checks

Scanned cards can now display names from this Mac's Wallet cache. Open **Check
missing cards** to distinguish current-scan matches from membership entries and
payment caches that still need confirmation. Use **Reconnect** for connection
problems and **Read Cache** to reread local metadata.

For payment cards, AirCard uses the NFC activation event for the card you
actually open. Wallet may also request artwork for several cards; IDs observed
in those current iPhone log paths can appear in a batch. Once a live ID matches
one specific remote-device cache, the remaining payment IDs from that same
cache are included so cards omitted by iOS logging still appear. Saved IDs from
an earlier run remain hidden until the current scan matches them again.

Cards and skin file paths are saved by ID separately for each iPhone, in stable
local discovery order. Only IDs matched during the current scan, either live or
through the live-ID-matched device cache, are shown or eligible to flash; saved
records only restore their skin after revalidation.
Cache counts are not the phone's total, and phone Wallet order is not synchronized. See
[card identification and diagnostics](docs/wallet-discovery.md).
### If scanning finds no cards

The scanner uses the iPhone's unified log service, including Info/Debug events.
On iOS 18.6.2, the legacy log service can show Wallet activity while omitting the
resource lookup messages that contain card identifiers.

Open **Log** and check for `Connected to the unified device log stream`, then
double-click the side button, authenticate, and tap or switch cards. If the log
reader stops, reconnect and unlock the iPhone, then start another scan. Values
that iOS replaces with `<private>` cannot be recovered by the scanner.

If your device previously connected but scanning found zero cards, please try
this build and report whether it helps. Include your iPhone model, iOS version,
macOS version, and the AirCard version or commit tested. Avoid posting full
device logs or card identifiers. See [scanner validation](docs/wallet-card-detection.md)
for the verified environment and remaining coverage.

## How to Apply Lockscreen Passcode Themes (.passthm)
1. Switch to the **Passcode Themes** tab at the top of AirCard.
2. Drag & drop any `.passthm` file into the app (or click **Choose .passthm File**).
3. AirCard will inspect the theme and display an interactive preview on the numeric keypad (0–9, *, #).
4. Click **Apply Passcode Theme**.
5. Restart your iPhone to reload the lock screen cache and see your custom passcode buttons!

> [!TIP]
> **Universal Language & Bold Text Support:**  
> AirCard automatically expands and flashes custom keypad assets for all system locales (English, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish, German, French, etc.) and generates both standard and **Bold Text** cache bitmaps (`--white` and `--white-bold`), ensuring your theme works regardless of your iOS language or accessibility display settings!
